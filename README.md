    - The search bar is not case sensitive
- Current Villagers List
    - Add villagers that are currently on the player's island
        - Only 10 villagers are allowed on an island in Animal Crossing, so the player can only add up to 10 villagers to the list
    - Release villagers from the island
        - Sometimes villagers request to leave the island to pursue their passion or go on an adventure. The player can let them go by clicking on the "Release" button
    - Players can add new villagers to their island after one has been release
